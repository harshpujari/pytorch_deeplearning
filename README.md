# PyTorch for Deep Learning Introduction

Welcome to the PyTorch for Deep Learning introductory course study materisl. In this repo I will upload everything I learn from pytorch youtube videos..

## Getting Started

- **Course Materials:** Access all course materials in an online book format at [learnpytorch.io](https://learnpytorch.io).
- **Prerequisites:** This course assumes 3-6 months of Python coding experience and basic familiarity with machine learning concepts. If you are new to these, consider [Zero to Mastery Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse).
- **Learning Style:** The course emphasizes a hands-on, code-first approach, allowing you to learn PyTorch through practical examples.

## Course Overview

This course covers the following key areas:

1. **PyTorch Fundamentals:** Learn basic PyTorch operations used in deep learning and neural networks.
2. **PyTorch Workflow:** Understand the approach to solving deep learning problems and building neural networks with PyTorch.
3. **Neural Network Classification:** Apply the PyTorch workflow to solve a neural network classification problem.
4. **Computer Vision with PyTorch:** Explore PyTorch for computer vision problems using the established workflow.
5. **Custom Datasets in PyTorch:** Learn how to load custom datasets into PyTorch and lay the foundations for modular code.
6. **Modular PyTorch Code:** Understand how to structure PyTorch code modularly, a common practice in real-world applications.
7. **Transfer Learning in PyTorch:** Utilize pre-trained models and adapt them to your own problems.
8. **Milestone Projects:** Engage in three projects covering experiment tracking, paper replicating, and model deployment.
